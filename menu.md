    - [Basic HTTP authentication user](#basic-http-authentication-user): 
    - [Basic HTTP authentication password](#basic-http-authentication-password): 
    - [Enable logging of requests that produce errors](#enable-logging-of-requests-that-produce-errors): This is an alternative to the debug mode for production environments. If enabled, even when the debug mode is disabled, the body of search requests that produce an error will be logged. If disabled, only the error message/exception message will be logged (legacy behavior). A log rotation system on the var/log/system.log file is advised if enabled.
    - [Enable Debug Mode](#enable-debug-mode): When enabled the module will produce logs through Magento logging system.
    - [Server Connection Timeout](#server-connection-timeout): In seconds.
    - [Elasticsearch Client Maximum Number of Retries](#elasticsearch-client-maximum-number-of-retries): Maximum number of times to retry connection when there is a connection failure

You can reduce this amount of time to speed up ghost indices cleanup, but take care to add a safety on top of the maximum reindexing duration of the more complex index of your platform (usually a catalog_product/product search index). Defaults to 172,800 seconds (2 days), minimum value: 3600 (1 hour).
- **[Analyzers Settings](#analyzers-settings)**
  - URL: {base_url}/admin/system_config/edit/section/smile_elasticsuite_core_analysis_settings
  - **[Reference analyzer configuration](#reference-analyzer-configuration)**
    - [Remove leading zeroes of numeric parts](#remove-leading-zeroes-of-numeric-parts): If enabled, when indexing a reference like "VT0009", it will be as if "VT9" was indexed instead (leading to independant elements "VT", "9" and "VT9" in the search index). This will allow someone searching for "vt9" or "vt 9" to find the product with the exact "VT0009" sku.
    - [Remove trailing zeroes of numeric parts](#remove-trailing-zeroes-of-numeric-parts): If enabled, when indexing a reference like "DC3000", it will be as if "DC3" was indexed instead (leading to independant elements "DC", "3" and "DC3" in the search index).

    - [Reduce series of contiguous zeroes in numeric parts](#reduce-series-of-contiguous-zeroes-in-numeric-parts): If enabled, when indexing a reference like "PL20004", it will be as if "PL204" was indexed instead (leading to independant elements "PL", "204" and "PL204" in the search index). This will allow someone searching for "pl204", "pl 204", "pl2004" or "pl 2004" to find the product with the exact "PL2004" sku.
  - **[Language stemmer configuration](#language-stemmer-configuration)**
    - [Settings available at the store view scope only.](#settings-available-at-the-store-view-scope-only): The ability to select an alternative language stemmer is only available at the store view scope.
    - [Use default stemmer](#use-default-stemmer): Use the default language stemmer as defined in 'elasticsuite_analysis.xml' file for this store language (as defined by the store locale). If set to No, you'll be able to select a different stemmer for languages that have multiple possible stemmers (Dutch, English, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish).
    - [Custom stemmer](#custom-stemmer): In the list "[default]" indicates the stemmer used by Elasticsuite by default for the language, while "[recommended]" indicates the stemmer is the one or one of those recommended for that language by Elasticsearch in its <a href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-stemmer-tokenfilter.html#analysis-stemmer-tokenfilter-configure-parms' target='_blank'>online documentation</a>. Those can differ, hence this configuration parameter.
- **[Autocomplete](#autocomplete)**
  - URL: {base_url}/admin/system_config/edit/section/smile_elasticsuite_autocomplete_settings
  - **[Popular Term Autocomplete](#popular-term-autocomplete)**
    - [Max Size](#max-size): Maximum number of popular search terms to display in autocomplete results.
  - **[Advanced Settings](#advanced-settings)**
    - [Using popular search terms for autocomplete search of products and categories](#using-popular-search-terms-for-autocomplete-search-of-products-and-categories): Historically, both for leveraging user behavioral patterns and performance purposes, Elasticsuite relies on the Popular Search Terms Autocomplete results to complete and extend the search terms submitted by the user before searching for matching products or categories.<br />For instance, if a user types "comp" in the search box and the suggested popular search terms are "computer", "peach computer", "computer for kids", then categories and products matching either one of those three search terms will be shown and the original "comp" search term is discarded.<br />On the other hand, if no popular search term is found, then Elasticsuite will try finding products and categories matching only "comp", which might not provide any results unless some attributes have built-in autocompletion capability (by using the "standard_edge_ngram" as their search analyzer).<br />The settings below provide you with the ability to have more control over that "extension" mechanism: whether to disable it entirely, limit its extend, forcing the original search term to always be requested, etc.
    - [Use suggested search terms to fetch results](#use-suggested-search-terms-to-fetch-results): Default: Yes (legacy behavior). When set to "Yes", products and categories autocomplete will use the search terms suggested in the popular term autocomplete. When set to "No", products and categories autocomplete results will be based solely on the original user raw search term, which might be a partial word being typed (eg "comp" for "computer").
    - [Always use the user raw input for suggestions](#always-use-the-user-raw-input-for-suggestions): Default: No (legacy behavior). When set to "No", the user raw search term, which might be a partial word being typed, will only be used to fetch suggestions if no matching popular terms were found. When set to "Yes", it will always be used, whether matching popular terms were found or not. Eg if set to "Yes" : when the user is typing "comp" and the popular search term "computer" is suggested, then products or categories matching either "comp" or "computer" will be shown.
    - [Limit the amount of suggested search terms used](#limit-the-amount-of-suggested-search-terms-used): Default: No (legacy behavior). When set to "No", all the suggested popular search terms will be used for the products and categories autocomplete. When set to "Yes", you will be able to define the maximum number of suggested search terms to use below.
    - [Maximum number of popular search terms to use](#maximum-number-of-popular-search-terms-to-use): The maximum number of suggested search terms that will be used for fetching results in the products and categories autocomplete boxes. Having a value greater than the "Max Size" defined in the "Popular Term Autocomplete" section above has no effect.
    - [No extension for actual popular search terms](#no-extension-for-actual-popular-search-terms): Default: No. When set to "Yes", the extension mechanism will be discarded when the search term entered by the user is amongst the popular terms suggestions. Eg : When the user has finished typing "computer", if the list of suggested search terms is ("computer", "peach computer", "computer for kids"), only "computer" will be taken into account for the products and categories autocomplete.

  - URL: {base_url}/admin/system_config/edit/section/smile_elasticsuite_thesaurus_settings
  - **[Cache settings](#cache-settings)**
    - [Always cache thesaurus application results](#always-cache-thesaurus-application-results): Set this to "No" to conditionally cache the results of user search query rewriting by active thesaurus rules. This can be used in peak trafic times to reduce the impact on your cache component with a trade-off of an increased volume of analysis requests sent to Elasticsearch/Opensearch and increased CPU usage.
    - [Minimum amount of alternative queries](#minimum-amount-of-alternative-queries): The minimum amount of alternative queries that must be generated for a given original user search for enabling the storage of the results in the cache component. Set this to 1, for instance, to only cache the results when there is at least one alternative query generated by the thesaurus rules. Defaults to 0: cache storage is used even when there is no alternative queries through the thesaurus.
