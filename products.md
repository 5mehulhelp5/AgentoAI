Pacific Safe Manufacturing TL-30 safes are tested from top to bottom by Underwriters Laboratories using techniques and tools a burglar would use. Once the safe passes all the tests, it is allowed to be stamped with a TL-30 label. A TL-30 rating enables insurance companies to insure contents valued up to $250,000 (may vary based on the insurer). Pacific Safes’s TL-30 vault body's are 3” thick while the door is 6” thick and is built using hardened steel, high-pressure concrete and other proprietary hard-to-drill products. The ten 1-¼” thick locking bolts ensure maximum security in case of a pry attack. The dual locking system provides the convenience of quick access using the electronic lock during the day. But can be locked up overnight with the mechanical dial as well, for additional security. The sturdy pull handle helps to easily open and close the TL-30's heavy door. The concrete filled walls provide a high 2 hour Fire Rating at up to 1750° F.

- **Description**:
  DetailsHollon RH-2014E Rotary Hopper Depository SafeWhen it comes to keeping your business's cash safe, an initial physical deterrent is often enough to deter an opportunistic thief. Having a Hollon RH-2014C Rotary Hopper Depository Safe in the office makes access to cash difficult enough to prevent many thefts. Many businesses have a large amount of cash in their offices at any one time, which is due to be transferred to the bank at a later date. This is also true of checks that should be safely stored until they can be moved to a secure location. The Hollon RH-2014E Rotary Hopper Depository Safe has a rotary turn style that allows for larger envelopes and cash bags to be deposited inside. The handle is turned to drop the deposit into the compartment below. The rotary does not allow access for anyone to be able to reach in and fish out deposits from the safe. Only the owner or manager can access the contents with the correct combination of the Group II combination dial lock. There are also 4 anchor holes which allows the safe to be securely bolted down to the floor.Be sure to keep your business’s cash and documents safe and secure with the Hollon RH-2014C Rotary Hopper Depository Safe!Features:Top Rotary Hopper DropB-Rated Depository SafeUL Listed Group 2 Dial Lock4 anchor holes (hardware not included)1/2″ thick solid steel door(3) 1.25″ Solid Steel Active Locking BoltsHeavy duty dead barSpecifications:Exterior Dimensions:20.00" H x 14.00" W x 14.00" DInterior Dimensions:12.75" H x 13.75" W x 11.30" DWeight:93 PoundsHollon RH-2014E Rotary Hopper Depository SafeAuthorized DealerModel:RH-2014EAvailability :Usually Ships in 3-5 Business DaysDimensions:Outside: 20.00" H X 14.00" W X 14.00" DInside: 12.75" H X 13.75" W X 11.30" DInterior Cubic Feet: 1.15Weight:93.00Burglar Rating: B-Rate

Has successfully resisted entry* for a net working time of 30 minutes when attacked with common hand tools, picking tools, mechanical or portable electric tools, grinding points, carbide drills, pressure applying devices or mechanisms, abrasive cutting wheels and power saws." Basically, they take every tool a smart burglar would use and punish the safe for 30 minutes on each side. If the safe survives, it is rated TL-30X6 and qualifies for Mercantile & Broadform Insurance Class G with a Bank Rating of H. So I'm sure you're wondering, how do they accomplish this?Let's start with themassive 6" door, constructed of a3" defense barrierof outer and inner steel plates creating a single structure encasing a unique, high density fire and burglary resistant composite material. This defense barrier on the AMSEC CFX252016 houses a proprietary amalgamation of nuggets and steel fibers to withstand concentrated attacks with the most sophisticated equipment used by burglars.

The hinges offer a vertical height adjustment and utilizes an oil impregnated bearing ensuring easy door operation.The locking mechanism on the AMSEC CFX252016 is equipped withsix massive 1-1/2" diameter chrome plated solid steel locking boltsthat move deep into the body's protected bolt chambers. The body is formed to combine a total protective thickness of 3-1/2" enclosing a high density, high-strength ceramic matrix with high strength concrete inside exceeding 12,000 PSI. The reinforced drill resistant door frame protects the door and each individual bolt chamber from severe side attacks. The proprietary inner barrier protects against peeling attacks.This AMSEC CFX252016 TL-30X6 safe has been tested for up totwo hours of fire protection at 1850°and successfully maintained an interior temperature of less than 350° for the entire duration of the test.Only at Dean Safe, we include options at no extra cost to you such as three-way bolt work that engages the bolts horizontally and vertically into the body of the safe, an auxiliary key lock that has two keys and an escutcheon plate with additional spring-loaded relocking device to protect against punch attacks and a tempered glass relocking device to protect against torch attacks with remotely and randomly placed cross locking bolt and thermal cords. Normally, these options would cost you an additional $660, but we include them for you for free!The AMSEC CFX252016 comes standard with one high strength adjustable shelf included and a tri-spoke handle and a chrome plated finial pull handle that makes opening the door smooth and easy.The AMSEC CFX252016 does not come standard with a bolt down hole as TL30x6 safes must be tested on all six sides, however it can be special ordered with one countersunk bolt down hole for mounting to a concrete slab.Not only is this AMSEC CFX252016made right here in the USAbut it is also backed by aOne Year Parts and Labor Warranty!When you plan on placing up to $500,000 worth of value in your safe, you can trust the AMSEC CFX252016 TL-30X6 high security safe.
